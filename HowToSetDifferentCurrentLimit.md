#How to set different charging current limit

# Setting different charging current limit (button) #

Sometimes it can be useful to limit charging current to lower values (camps, weak breaker, old aluminium wiring).

Before you start charging the vehicle:
  * push and hold the button
  * LED will flash rapidly
  * the number of flashes determines charging current [[A](A.md)]
  * release the button, LED will flash rapidly
  * charging current has been set to desired value (between 5A - 80A)
  * if you set for example only 2A (two blinks) there will be minimum 5A set

Default charging current 16A is set every time the plug is removed from the electric network (reset).
